## Bugs
```
When component added to container without replacing any existing, it's not setting the wrapper events
```
## Refactor
```
Pass the setup root script methods into the components' Vue structure (methods).
Nevertheless the runtime load does not work inside component struct, so still needs to stay on root
```
